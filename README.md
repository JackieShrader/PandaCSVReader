# PandaCSVReader
Accepts a .csv file. Removes any duplicate users at the same company, keeping the one with the latest version. 
Then goes ahead and ouputs a unique .csv file for each company encountered. 

TestData.csv is what I used for initial testing.
MOCK_DATA (3).csv was used to test a larger data set.
